3-1. Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. Print
each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.
3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just
printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the
person’s name.
3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a
motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list
to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a
Honda motorcycle.”
